# MultiUser-Chat-App

## Description
Welcome to my project! This is a realtime multi-user chat room console implementation in Python. It allows different console windows connected to a ,common server console window, interact with each other via text messages in realtime. I hope to expand it to be console app in which users connected in a LAN network can use it. Will try it some other time. If anyone is willing to contribute, i welcome all contributions!!
